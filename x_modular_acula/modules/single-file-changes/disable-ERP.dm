//Hey guess what this file is for
/datum/config_entry/flag/disable_erp_preferences
	default = TRUE
//That's right it's the file that disables some ERP flags.
/datum/config_entry/flag/disable_lewd_items
	default = TRUE
//(Yes this works, I think purely because the acula module is included last in the DME.)
